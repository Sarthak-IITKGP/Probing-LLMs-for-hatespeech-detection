If either Trump or Clinton are elected, we will see more grid-lock from the opposing party unless we push the entire RNC/DNC out of office for a term. Doing this would cause the people from the opposing party to backlash where they can. My thinking is, instead of the predictable Left or Right hook from the people, how about a kick to the groin. Neither the RNC or DNC would see it coming. I think it would send a clear message to our government that the people are tired of the circus show in D.C.

In addition,  do NOT expect the CRA to ever be fair or make any sense.  Anyone that has dealt with them knows that their lawyers, auditors, and staff, all seem to live in a bubble where common sense is the last thing on their minds.  They're after tax dollars, they want to meet their quotas, and they are rewarded by the Federal government for doing as they are told.  That's why the small business proposals are so controversial.  Once you pass new laws and let the CRA figure out how to handle them, the TAX PAYERS which are the ones that ultimately fund the CRA get screwed through unfair and senseless practices.

Last year and this year I did two sizable transfers between BMOInvestorline and Nesbitt-Burns (both owned by BMO). My experience is the transfer time should be talked about in 'weeks' rather than days. The problem seems to be with BMOInvestorline. In both cases, after waiting a 'reasonable' amount of time (1 - 2 weeks) I called them to complain and the transfer happened fairly quickly after that.  My conclusion is that Investorline simply doesn't allocate very many people to deal with these transactions (note that stock trades, for instance, are completed in 3 days). Hence if you call up to complain, your file gets pulled from the pile and dealt with. I feel sorry to complain about this as, otherwise, they've been a good bank to deal with.  Oh well.

The police don disguises, burst into homes and businesses to summarily shoot suspected drug offenders--not just major traffickers but small-volume peddlers and users too, even addicts who weeks earlier had voluntarily turned themselves in to confess using drugs--mere users. Disguised police also use motorbikes driven in tandem to whack even low-level users on the streets and in alleyways, according to one online press account. I can't see how any American would condone what is presumably happening in the Philippines. An Unholy Nightmare--how will the rest of the impoverished populace ever trust police authority again, I don't know; how will future Philippine national leaders even be able to govern?

The younger the children victimized, the greater the injury, and the less chance of reforming the perpetrator.       Here in the Interior, actual sentences of crimes against the very young and 'tweens, taking into account suspended time, etc, are often shockingly light, compared with many other States, especially when the perpetrator is 'somebody' of gov't employ, or influence w/gov't [which generally includes well-heeled businessmen].

I support a flat sales tax and a system of users fees where everyone pays the bills of the state. The more you buy, the more you pay. Under an income tax, those who paid no tax would not care what the bills of the state were and would not care about voting for politicians who showed restraint with spending taxpayer money.

990793	Jamie, thanks for your analysis. I have shared many of your observations during the campaign, election and three week presidential term.  I am ashamed that, for the sake of survival, African American parents must teach their children what to do during a police stop. I am complicit in allowing a culture of fear to grow. And, now my daughters have to teach my grandchildren about immigration raids and prepare them if ICE ever comes knocking on the neighborhood doors. Oh but there's more. Tennessee is considering a bill that would declare children conceived through artificial insemination illegitimate. This affects my family.  I am beyond disappointed in my brother's in the USCCB. Some may attempt to dismiss them of responsibility for our present situation, but I would encourage my brothers to meditate on Paul's confession concerning Stephen's stoning. Although he didn't throw a stone, he held the cloaks of the murderers for them.	Non_Toxic	[]	"['Non_Toxic', '<<<""Jamie"",""African', 'American"",""ICE"",""Tenn']"

I have plenty of reasons, family and otherwise, to be against drug use but  execution is not something I am in favor of either and we do not have the death penalty in this state so most Alaskans, at one point in time, apparently agreed with my opinion.

937759	Gauging by comments made by Trudeau supporters, about this subject on many of the articles provided by this newspaper, he had the mandate and full backing from Canadians to arbitrarily make change to the electoral system on his own.  When opposition arose and polls showed that Canadians would not support this change without a referendum, the grandstanding of this being the last FPTP election, gradually faded away and was reflected as Canadians lacking interest.  Trudeau will not let principles stand in the way if there is a potential to damage his popularity.  He has also learned a lesson in democracy and the risk of making dictatorial changes on his own without a clear mandate supported by Canadians.   Too bad about all the $millions wasted on this issue.

6323609	Popular election of the chief executive does not determine whether a government is a pure democracy. In Gallup polls since they started asking in 1944 until this election, only about 20% of the public has supported the current system of awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the presidential candidate who receives the most votes in each separate state (not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, but later enacted by 48 states) (with about 70% opposed and about 10% undecided). Support for a national popular vote for President has been strong among Republicans, Democrats, and Independent voters, as well as every demographic group in every state surveyed. In the 41 red, blue, and purple states surveyed, overall support has been in the 67-81% range - in rural, smal, Southern, big states, and other states polled.  Most Americans think it is wrong that the candidate with the most popular votes can lose. We don't allow this in any other election in our representative republic.

986132	Okay, let's examine this a bit.  Even for a strong earthquake, strong damage typically extends for about a hundred mile radius.  Thus the maximum warning time is 50 seconds (two mps surface wave).  Areas susceptible to the worst damage will get substantially shorter warning times.    Maximum warning cannot realistically be achieved as instrumentation must analyze signals for a certain duration and, given no time for human examination, automated warnings must be verified by multiple stations to prevent false alarm.  Then the signal must be transmitted.  Suppose magically, that cell phone notifications could go out in ten seconds.  How long does it take for a person to hear a notification, retrieve their cell phone and read a message?  Say another 15 seconds.  So even at 100 miles there is only 25 seconds warning.  Can one get out of an office bldg in 25 sec?.  Within 50 miles, the earthquake has already hit.  Imagine the potential loss of life in the event of a false warning.
