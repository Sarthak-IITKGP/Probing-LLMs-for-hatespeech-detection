They immediately celebrate their collective genius and return to the house.  The next day they go outside and discover nothing but a pile of warm rocks. So what do the do?  They try again to get the granite rocks to burn and again they fail.   So then they decide that they chose the wrong type of rocks.

They still believe Trump can change things by himself when confronted with the juggernaut DC culture that doesn't blindly support everything he says.  They support him even when his actions are contradictory to what he said.  They still believe he is capable of changing everything single-handedly even when he failed to repeal the ACA with a friendly majority in both chambers of Congress.  There is nothing that will pierce the zealous belief they have in Trump.  I bet he could walk up to Betty White, bend her over against her will and spank her on live national TV and they would all fabricate some justification for his conduct so long as he doesn't admit it outright on Twitter.

502539	You are correct that value judgments of right and wrong are human constructs and thus are totally subjective. However, precisely because they are human constructs, how would you expect to apply them to nonhuman animals? Just because all animals can feel pain and suffer does not mean that non-human animals can think or reason in a way that might reduce their pain in the future or the pain that they might inflict on other animals in their effort to survive. The bear is not getting a free pass because it is not sentient, but because we cannot change the habit of the bear or talk to a bear to convince it to be a vegetarian without being able to converse with it (and perhaps we would not want to change its habit). Sentience has nothing to do with the bear's inability to exchange ideas with humans. Humans have the ability to think about how we can change the way we do things in the future - animals, as far as we know, do not, or at least on a very limited basis. So I don't see your point.

He did so well that it locked Papa Bush as well. That was a long time ago however... I think our current President has good intentions but has basically given up because of the government grid-lock. If either Trump or Clinton are elected, we will see more grid-lock from the opposing party unless we push the entire RNC/DNC out of office for a term. Doing this would cause the people from the opposing party to backlash where they can. My thinking is, instead of the predictable Left or Right hook from the people, how about a kick to the groin. Neither the RNC or DNC would see it coming. I think it would send a clear message to our government that the people are tired of the circus show in D.C.

Completely ignored is the welfare of these million dollar animals that hundreds of thousands of  paying visitors seek with their  choice to visit Denali but fail to see.

642834	"To say, ""The Electoral College is one of the last remnants of slavery in the Constitution"" is historically false.   When voting for president, the framers of the Constitution decided that the states should do the voting, not the people.  Voting for president was to take place by state, so that each state could have its say.  The compromise between big and small states was extended to the Electoral College, so that each state has as many electors as it has senators and members of the House combined.  Big states still have the most influence, but small states aren't completely lost on the national vote.  There is no national election for president, but rather fifty-one separate elections, one in each state and one in the District of Columbia. ""So, just what do you mean by  ""majority?""

In addition,  do NOT expect the CRA to ever be fair or make any sense.  Anyone that has dealt with them knows that their lawyers, auditors, and staff, all seem to live in a bubble where common sense is the last thing on their minds.  They're after tax dollars, they want to meet their quotas, and they are rewarded by the Federal government for doing as they are told.  That's why the small business proposals are so controversial.

5140528	Some people create their own homelessness. Someone who is low income or on Housing Assistance will violate their rental agreement in some way or another one time to many and will get evicted.  There's a reason that so many property owners avoided Section 8 like the plague: too often their property would be destroyed. I find it interesting that people complain so bitterly about the rental shortage and how renters are treated unfairly. A drive down the street in a modest neighborhood - you can usually spot the rentals.  Maybe owners should add yard maintenance and garbage service to the rent. It might add another $100 to rent,  but it would eliminate a potential problem for the tenant.

5011328	"Hans von Spakovsky, Heritage Foundation, in ""The Conservative Review"" March 15, 2017 said ""... watching the attorney general of Hawaii, Doug Chin, condemn President Donald Trump’s revised immigration order as “blatantly discriminatory” was quite ironic, given that Hawaii is the home of a state government that constantly engages in blatant racial and ethnic discrimination ... Hawaii “is in a league by itself” when it comes to officially sanctioned discriminatory conduct. Hawaii has some nerve claiming that the revised executive order “differentiates between people based on their … national origin.” That is something the Hawaiian government does every day — differentiate between people based on their origin and whether they can trace their bloodlines back to 1778. ...

633698	> Wealthsimple says that among major financial institutions, Bank of Montreal has the slowest transfer time – 24 days. However, BMO disputes the figure. Last year and this year I did two sizable transfers between BMOInvestorline and Nesbitt-Burns (both owned by BMO). My experience is the transfer time should be talked about in 'weeks' rather than days. The problem seems to be with BMOInvestorline. In both cases, after waiting a 'reasonable' amount of time (1 - 2 weeks) I called them to complain and the transfer happened fairly quickly after that.  My conclusion is that Investorline simply doesn't allocate very many people to deal with these transactions (note that stock trades, for instance, are completed in 3 days). Hence if you call up to complain, your file gets pulled from the pile and dealt with. I feel sorry to complain about this as, otherwise, they've been a good bank to deal with.  Oh well. If enough people complain, maybe they'll wake up and do something about it.

It must always be remembered that he didn't go there to fight the West, or the Americans. They went there to fight him. Also, it's a shame we don't look more favourably on the courage and commitment he demonstrated.

There is a significant difference between severe sex crimes committed against pre-pubescent children, and those against 'tweens , and those against underage teens - both in that depth of damage done [physical and emotional], and in the rehab potential for the criminal. The younger the children victimized, the greater the injury, and the less chance of reforming the perpetrator.       Here in the Interior, actual sentences of crimes against the very young and 'tweens, taking into account suspended time, etc, are often shockingly light, compared with many other States, especially when the perpetrator is 'somebody' of gov't employ, or influence w/gov't [which generally includes well-heeled businessmen].

That's the legacy he chose to leave behind.  Stevens was heard on Public Radio ranting and raving that the Alaska Native population was growing to fast and out pacing the non-Native population.

Talk to your neighbors, including those who voted for Trump.     If it goes badly, go to the street in peaceful protest, sign petitions, prepare for the next election cycle.   I don't like what I've seen in the appointments, but really all are pretty much the same small government vision that the Republican party has held for at least 50 years.    It seems that Democrats have over reached what they believe should be the role of government in American lives, roles that go well beyond defense, and regulation of commerce, (those being items that are central to our federation design).

That is unless you are one of the citizens who would pay no income tax. Forty percent or more of the residents do not pay a federal income tax & would not have to pay a state income tax. That is wrong. The bills of the state are owned by everybody who lives here, not just a targeted group of people. I support a flat sales tax and a system of users fees where everyone pays the bills of the state. The more you buy, the more you pay. Under an income tax, those who paid no tax would not care what the bills of the state were and would not care about voting for politicians who showed restraint with spending taxpayer money.

There should be a new statue building on the mall for Obama. I saw PLENTY, PLENTY, PLENTY of WIDE OPEN SPACE on the mall for a large and opulent tribute to Obama.

990793	Jamie, thanks for your analysis. I have shared many of your observations during the campaign, election and three week presidential term.  I am ashamed that, for the sake of survival, African American parents must teach their children what to do during a police stop. I am complicit in allowing a culture of fear to grow. And, now my daughters have to teach my grandchildren about immigration raids and prepare them if ICE ever comes knocking on the neighborhood doors. Oh but there's more. Tennessee is considering a bill that would declare children conceived through artificial insemination illegitimate. This affects my family.  I am beyond disappointed in my brother's in the USCCB. Some may attempt to dismiss them of responsibility for our present situation, but I would encourage my brothers to meditate on Paul's confession concerning Stephen's stoning. Although he didn't throw a stone, he held the cloaks of the murderers for them.

736127	As for the senior citizen exemption on property tax bills, the state lays out some fairly simple rules for that. Over 61 years of age, annual income of less than $40,000 per year, which in Kitsap county puts a household of two in the 57% income bracket, and that property must be the primary residence. There are additional criteria for people with disabilities. Mountain view and waterfront in the 57th percentile shows a pretty well off couple that the state determines can afford to pay their property taxes. There is also no precedent for using federal taxes to fund state schools based on number of children on income tax returns. Federal school funding is generally dispersed via the Department of Education grant system, leaving states to fund their own schools independently. Not the greatest system, but we have bigger problems with the federal government than that currently.

6323609	Popular election of the chief executive does not determine whether a government is a pure democracy. In Gallup polls since they started asking in 1944 until this election, only about 20% of the public has supported the current system of awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the presidential candidate who receives the most votes in each separate state (not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, but later enacted by 48 states) (with about 70% opposed and about 10% undecided). Support for a national popular vote for President has been strong among Republicans, Democrats, and Independent voters, as well as every demographic group in every state surveyed.

986132	Okay, let's examine this a bit.  Even for a strong earthquake, strong damage typically extends for about a hundred mile radius.  Thus the maximum warning time is 50 seconds (two mps surface wave).  Areas susceptible to the worst damage will get substantially shorter warning times.    Maximum warning cannot realistically be achieved as instrumentation must analyze signals for a certain duration and, given no time for human examination, automated warnings must be verified by multiple stations to prevent false alarm.  Then the signal must be transmitted.  Suppose magically, that cell phone notifications could go out in ten seconds.  How long does it take for a person to hear a notification, retrieve their cell phone and read a message?  Say another 15 seconds.  So even at 100 miles there is only 25 seconds warning.  Can one get out of an office bldg in 25 sec?.  Within 50 miles, the earthquake has already hit.  Imagine the potential loss of life in the event of a false warning.
